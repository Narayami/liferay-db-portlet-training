	<h1 align="center">Greek Mythology</h1>
	<p>
		“Myth has two main functions,” the poet and scholar Robert Graves wrote in 1955. 
		“The first is to answer the sort of awkward questions that children ask, such as 
		‘Who made the world? How will it end? Who was the first man? Where do souls go after death?’
		…The second function of myth is to justify an existing social system and account for traditional 
		rites and customs.” In ancient Greece, stories about gods and goddesses and heroes and monsters 
		were an important part of everyday life. They explained everything from religious rituals to the 
		weather, and they gave meaning to the world people saw around them.

<div class="myDiv1">
	<h1 align="center">Greek Mythology: Sources</h1>
	<p>In Greek mythology, there is no single original text like the Christian Bible or the Hindu Vedas that 
		introduces all of the myths’ characters and stories. Instead, the earliest Greek myths were part of an oral 
		tradition that began in the Bronze Age, and their plots and themes unfolded gradually in the written 
		literature of the archaic and classical periods. 
		The poet Homer’s 8th-century BC epics the Iliad and the Odyssey, for example, tell the story 
		of the (mythical) Trojan War as a divine conflict as well as a human one. They do not, however, bother to 
		introduce the gods and goddesses who are their main characters, since readers and listeners would already have been 
		familiar with them.
		Did you know? Many consumer products get their names from Greek mythology. 
		Nike sneakers are the namesake of the goddess 
		of victory, for example, and the website Amazon.com is named after the race of 
		mythical female warriors. Many high school, 
		college and professional sports teams (Titans, Spartans and Trojans, for instance) also 
		get their names from mythological sources.
		Around 700 BC, the poet Hesiod’s Theogony offered the first written cosmogony, or origin story, 
		of Greek mythology. The Theogony tells the 
		story of the universe’s journey from nothingness (Chaos, a primeval void) to being, and details an 
		elaborate family tree of elements, gods and 
		goddesses who evolved from Chaos and descended from Gaia (Earth), Ouranos (Sky), Pontos (Sea) a
		nd Tartaros (the Underworld).
		Later Greek writers and artists used and elaborated upon these sources in their own work. 
		For instance, mythological figures and 
		events appear in the 5th-century plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides and the lyric poems of Pindar. 
		Writers such as the 2nd-century BC Greek mythographer Apollodorus of 
		Athens and the 1st-century BC Roman historian Gaius Julius Hyginus compiled the 
		ancient myths and legends for contemporary audiences.

	<h1 align="center">Greek Mythology: The Olympians</h1>
	<p>
		At the center of Greek mythology is the pantheon of deities who were said to 
		live on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. From their perch, they 
		ruled every aspect of human life. Olympian gods and goddesses looked like men and women 
		(though they could change themselves into animals and other things) and were–as many myths 
		recounted–vulnerable to human foibles and passions.
		
		The twelve main Olympians are:
		
		Zeus (Jupiter, in Roman mythology): the king of all the gods (and father to many) 
		and god of weather, law and fate
		Hera (Juno): the queen of the gods and goddess of women and marriage
		Aphrodite (Venus): goddess of beauty and love
		Apollo (Apollo): god of prophesy, music and poetry and knowledge
		Ares (Mars): god of war
		Artemis (Diana): goddess of hunting, animals and childbirth
		Athena (Minerva): goddess of wisdom and defense
		Demeter (Ceres): goddess of agriculture and grain
		Dionysos (Bacchus): god of wine, pleasure and festivity
		Hephaistos (Vulcan): god of fire, metalworking and sculpture
		Hermes (Mercury): god of travel, hospitality and trade and Zeus’s personal messenger
		Poseidon (Neptune): god of the sea
		Other gods and goddesses sometimes included in the roster of Olympians are:
		
		Hades (Pluto): god of the underworld
		Hestia (Vesta): goddess of home and family
		Eros (Cupid): god of sex and minion to Aphrodite
